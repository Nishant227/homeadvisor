1.<b>INTRODUCTION TO HOMEADVISOR</b><br>
Upon registration, you may choose your own password or HomeAdvisor will assign you a password to access the Services through the HomeAdvisor website or apps.
<br><br>
2.<b>THE STANDARD SERVICES</b><br>
At HomeAdvisor we are committed to making your total HomeAdvisor experience a positive one. There are several ways you can find service professionals through HomeAdvisor (collectively, "Service Professionals"). Profinder is our service where you request a referral for a specific task, and we refer you to up to four Service Professionals. Also you may select or search for individual Service Professionals from our Live Directory (a.k.a. Pro Reviews), a directory of Service Professional members along with their ratings and reviews.<br><br>
a.<b>ProFinder.</b> Upon entering your information and the request for which you would like a Service Professional, we will attempt to match you with up to four Service Professionals in your area, who may be interested in fulfilling your service need. However, we do not guarantee that we will be able to match your service needs with a Service Professional or that there are Service Professionals in your area that are either capable or willing to complete your service needs.<br><br>
b.<b>LiveDirectory (a.k.a. ProReviews).</b> You can view a directory of Service Professionals in your selected zip code who provide services in the project categories that you select. These listings include ratings and reviews of those Service Professionals from their customers, when available.<br><br>
c.<b>Instant Connect.</b> With Instant Connect, you can request that HomeAdvisor connect you with a Service Professional by phone immediately. If you request, HomeAdvisor will search for a Service Professional and connect you with them by phone.<br><br>
d.<b>Instant Booking.</b> You can choose to schedule appointments with certain of our Service Professionals right on the HomeAdvisor website. Please be aware that HomeAdvisor does not guarantee that the Service Professionals will be on time for, or show up for, any such booked appointments, as the Service Professionals are not the employees, contractors or agents of HomeAdvisor. HomeAdvisor is solely providing the platform to facilitate scheduling of appointments between you and the Service Professionals.<br><br>
e.<b>No Guarantees or Endorsements.</b> Although we take certain steps to examine the credentials of the Service Professionals listed on our website or whom you may book using our Services, we make no guarantees, warranties or representations regarding the skills or undertakings of such Service Professional or the quality of the job that he or she may perform for you if you elect to retain their services. HomeAdvisor does not endorse or recommend the services of any particular Service Professional. Except as set forth below in Paragraph 11 and Paragraph 12, we do not independently verify their representations about their services, nor validate any reviews. It is entirely up to you to evaluate the Service Professional and the Service Professional's qualifications, and to enter into a direct contract or otherwise reach agreement with a Service Professional. We do not guarantee or warrant any Service Professional's performance on the job or the outcome or quality of the services performed. The Service Professionals are not employees or agents of HomeAdvisor, nor is HomeAdvisor an agent of the Service Professionals.<br><br>
f.<b>No Contracting via the HomeAdvisor Website.</b> HomeAdvisor may inform you of certain offers or discounts provided by a Service Professional. Such offers or discounts are made solely by the Service Professional, and HomeAdvisor does not guarantee or warrant the pricing or discounts that a Service Professional may offer you. Any quotes provided by Service Professionals via the HomeAdvisor or apps, or which you find on the HomeAdvisor or apps, are not contractually binding offers, are for informational purposes only, and cannot be accepted on or via HomeAdvisor. No contractual arrangement is created based upon the quotes provided to you from Service Professionals (or your scheduling of an appointment with a Service Professional) via HomeAdvisor. To contract with a Service Professional, you must work directly with the Service Professional. HomeAdvisor does not perform, and is not responsible for, any of the Services requested by you in your service request. Your rights under contracts you enter into with Service Professionals are governed by the terms of such contracts and by applicable federal, state, provincial and local laws. HomeAdvisor is not a party to such agreements. All payments and applicable taxes must be made to the Service Professional in accordance with the agreements.<br><br>
g.<b>Release from Damages or Claims.</b> Should you have a dispute with respect to any services provided by a Service Professional or the fees charged by any Service Professional, you must address such dispute with the Service Professional directly (although you may copy HomeAdvisor on the fee disputes). YOU HEREBY AGREE TO RELEASE HomeAdvisor (AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS) FROM ANY DAMAGES OR CLAIMS (INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL AND INCIDENTAL DAMAGES) OF EVERY KIND OR NATURE, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, AND DISCLOSED OR UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES AND YOUR DEALINGS WITH SERVICE PROFESSIONALS.<br><br>

4.<b>PAYMENTS</b><br>

Should you have any dispute with the goods or services provided by the Service Professional(s) you select, as set forth in in Section 2(f), you must contact the Service Professional and resolve such dispute with the Service Professional. However, if the dispute is regarding the amount of money that you paid for the services by the Service Professional (including that you were not charged the amount you agreed to in your agreement with the Service Professional) please advise us immediately. If we have not heard from you with documented proof of any issues provided within ten (10) days after the payment has been made for the Service Professional services, the purchase of the services is final and you will not be entitled to a refund, except as may expressly be limited by Federal, state or local law.<br><br>

5.<b>HOMEADVISOR PAY</b><br>
a.When a project has been completed, you may be offered the ability to pay your Service Professional directly via the HomeAdvisor mobile application (“HomeAdvisor Pay”). If your Service Professional has opted in to HomeAdvisor Pay, you will be able to log into your HomeAdvisor App, select which Service Professional you are paying, enter the amount of the payment, and input your method of payment (only credit card, Android Pay, and Apple Pay are permitted). Your Service Professional may also initiate the payment request. If you use HomeAdvisor Pay to pay your Service Professional but did not book your home service through HomeAdvisor, you will not be eligible for the HomeAdvisor Happiness Guarantee. By using HomeAdvisor Pay even where you were not previously a HomeAdvisor member, you are agreeing to HomeAdvisor’s terms and conditions.<br><br>
b.By participating in HomeAdvisor Pay and agreeing to the HomeAdvisor Terms, you agree that HomeAdvisor is authorized to charge your method of payment for the amount selected by you in the App, and to for HomeAdvisor’s payment processor, Stripe, to store such credit card information in case of future payments. The Service Professional will have sixty (60) days after you submit your payment to collect the payment. Should the Service Professional opt out of HomeAdvisor Pay at any time or fail to collect your payment within this fourteen day period, you will be notified and the payment will be refunded to your method of payment. In this case, you will need to pay the Service Professional directly, and you represent and warrant that you will promptly do so for the full amount owed for your project.<br><br>
c.You authorize HomeAdvisor to confirm that your method of payment is in good standing with the issuing financial institution, including, but not limited to, by submitting a request for a payment authorization and/or a low dollar credit and/or debit to the method of payment in accordance with the relevant card association as applicable. HomeAdvisor, in its sole and absolute discretion, may refuse to approve or may terminate existing enrollments for HomeAdvisor Pay with or without cause or notice, other than any notice required by any applicable law, and not waived herein. Payments made through HomeAdvisor Pay are also subject to the terms and conditions governing your method of payment between you and the issuer of your method of payment. You are responsible for any charges and related fees that may be imposed under the terms and conditions of your method of payment.<br><br>
d.You acknowledge and agree that your payments through HomeAdvisor Pay are transactions between you and the Service Professional and not with HomeAdvisor or any of its affiliates. HomeAdvisor is not a party to your payments unless expressly designated as such on the HomeAdvisor website. You also agree that HomeAdvisor may update your payment information, including expiration date and card number, due to information received under certain account updater programs created by payment networks. Under these programs, enrolled card issuers and merchants can provide and/or receive up to date payment card-related information from payment networks regarding your method of payment stored by HomeAdvisor. HomeAdvisor may reflect these changes to your stored payment information to prevent payment failure or service termination.<br><br>
e.You also agree that a Service Professional, and HomeAdvisor acting on behalf of the Service Professional, may resubmit a payment for processing one or more times in the event that a prior payment made through HomeAdvisor Pay is declined or returned by the payment network.<br><br>
f.HomeAdvisor Pay may not be used to process a payment, or otherwise transfer money between you and a Service Professional, that is unrelated to your purchase of services from the Service Professional. You may not use HomeAdvisor Pay to purchase any illegal goods or services or for any other underlying illegal transaction. You agree that you will not use HomeAdvisor Pay to purchase any services or products that violate these Terms, other policies or rules applicable to HomeAdvisor Pay, or applicable law. Failure to comply with these limitations may result in suspension or termination of your use of HomeAdvisor Pay and/or your HomeAdvisor account.<br><br>
g.Except as set forth in these Terms, all payments processed are non-refundable to you by HomeAdvisor and are non-reversible by you through HomeAdvisor Pay. You may have additional refund or charge-back rights under your method of payment issuer agreement or applicable state and federal laws.<br><br>
h.You agree to release HomeAdvisor, its affiliates, and their agents, contractors, officers and employees, from all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) arising out of or in any way connected with a dispute related to HomeAdvisor Pay. You agree that you will not involve HomeAdvisor in any litigation or other dispute arising out of or related to any transaction, agreement, or arrangement in connection with HomeAdvisor Pay. If you attempt to do so, (i) you shall pay all costs and attorneys' fees of HomeAdvisor and its affiliates and shall provide indemnification as set forth below, and (ii) the jurisdiction for any such litigation or dispute shall be limited as set forth in Section 19. However, nothing in these Terms waives any rights, claims or defenses that you may have with respect to a payment under an agreement with your method of payment issuer, the card association rules or applicable state and federal laws. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other personal information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any damage that may result should any information be released to any third parties, and you agree to hold us harmless for any damages that may result therefrom.<br><br>
h.Payment processing services are provided by Stripe and are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, located at https://stripe.com/us/connect-account/legal, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service, located at https://stripe.com/us/legal (collectively, the Stripe Services Agreement). By agreeing to these Terms herein, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of participating in HomeAdvisor Pay through Stripe, you agree to provide HomeAdvisor accurate and complete information about you, and you authorize HomeAdvisor to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.<br><br>

SERVICE PROFESSIONAL PRESCREENING PROCEDURES AND DISCLAIMERS (DOES NOT APPLY TO FIXED PRICE SERVICES OR PROJECT ADVISOR SERVICES).
Unless otherwise noted on the screening tab of a Service Professional's profile page, HomeAdvisor.com uses the following criteria as part of its registration enrollment process ("registration") for new Service Professional businesses, with the exception of Corporate Accounts (as described below) and service professionals providing services in Canada (neither of which are screened) applying for membership in our network. We perform the below screening at the time of the Service Professional business' enrollment, and every two years thereafter:
Licensing - We confirm that a prospective new SP business has any applicable required state-level trade licensing for the services for which we match them to consumers. Certain states may require state-level licensing for projects above specified dollar amounts. We recommend you confirm these licensing requirements with the business and the applicable state and local licensing authorities. In some states, licensing may be required by the county or local authority in which the work is being performed. We recommend you confirm these licensing requirements before proceeding with your project. Larger projects often require the use of sub-contractors for specific types of work (for example, a kitchen remodel may require an electrician or plumber). We recommend you verify that all the sub-contractors doing work on your project carry the appropriate licensing. Given the unique nature of California licensing, HomeAdvisor relies on representations of service professionals that are using a California General building contracting license to cover home improvement tasks that such service professionals are performing more than one task as defined and required by California licensing rules. We always recommend that you ask the business to provide you with a copy of their license.
State Business Filings - For service professionals that are corporations or limited liability companies, we confirm that the business is registered in the state in which it is located.
Criminal Records Search - We use third party data sources to conduct a criminal search, in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located, for any relevant criminal convictions associated with the owner/principal of the business, within the three years prior to such service professional's application for membership in the HomeAdvisor network and every two years thereafter. HomeAdvisor's third-party vendor uses a national criminal database ("NCD") to screen our service professionals. The comprehensiveness of the NCD varies by state. Please be aware that the reporting in the NCD is particularly limited in the following states: AL, CO, DE, GA, ID, KS, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, SD, UT, VA, VT, and WY.
Sex Offender Search - We check the websites that consolidate state sex offender information in the state in which the owner/principal of the company is located to confirm that there is not a match based solely on the name of the owner/principal of the company. We do not run sex offender searches in any other states. Please note that only a fingerprint match can guarantee an accurate match for a sex offender search. We recommend that you check the applicable state sex offender websites for any individuals that will be performing work in your home.
WE PERFORM THE ABOVE SCREENING BASED UPON INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US BY THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL (E.G. NAME OF OWNER, BIRTHDATE).

NOTE: HOMEADVISOR PERFORMS SCREENING SOLELY AT THE TIME THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL APPLIES FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE HOMEADVISOR NETWORK, AND EVERY TWO YEARS THEREAFTER, AND THEREFORE A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S INFORMATION MAY CHANGE OR EXPIRE OVER TIME, AND BETWEEN SCREENINGS. THUS, HOMEADVISOR CANNOT AND DOES NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT THAT PROFILE AND SCREENING INFORMATION IS UP TO DATE. HOMEADVISOR IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S SCREENING INFORMATION. WE RECOMMEND THAT BEFORE WORKING WITH A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL YOU VERIFY THAT INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S PROFILE IS STILL ACCURATE, CURRENT AND ACCEPTABLE TO YOU.

Corporate Accounts: Some Service Professionals are employees, franchisees, dealers, or independent contractors ("Corporate SP's") of larger national or corporate accounts ("Corporate Accounts"). In such event, you may be matched with the Corporate Account entity or with one of their Corporate SP's. The above screening criteria is not applicable to Corporate Accounts, and therefore, HomeAdvisor does not screen the Corporate Accounts or Corporate SP's.

Service Professionals Profiles: HomeAdvisor allows Service Professionals to post profiles about themselves and their business on the HomeAdvisor or apps. HomeAdvisor does not review or verify the information or representations set forth in those profiles, except as expressly set forth above, as they are self-reported by the Service Professional. HomeAdvisor therefore makes no representations or warranties regarding any information posted by a Service Professional, and assumes no liability for such information.

The above procedures may change from time to time at the sole discretion of HomeAdvisor. HomeAdvisor believes that it uses commercially reasonable methods to check these matters but does not make any representations or warranties that members continue to meet the above screening criteria after the date of their enrollment in the HomeAdvisor network. When it comes to screening, every system has its flaws. That is because no background system in the U.S. is one hundred percent accurate. HomeAdvisor does not represent or warrant that the information received from state, provincial or other government agencies or from third party sources is accurate, error free, or that it is up to date or updated at the time that HomeAdvisor checks such information. Most agencies have periodic update cycles or schedules and this information is not updated on a real-time basis by such agencies and third party sources.

DISCLAIMER: HOMEADVISOR EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED RELATING TO THE SCREENING PROCESS, CRITERIA, PROCEDURES, OR INFORMATION OBTAINED OR PRESENTED IN THE SCREENING PROCESS OR DISCLOSURES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE, OR THAT THE SCREENING OR VERIFICATION PROCEDURES OR STANDARDS ARE SUFFICIENT OR THAT THE INFORMATION RECEIVED IN THESE SCREENING OR VERIFICATION PROCEDURES IS ACCURATE, TIMELY OR ERROR FREE.
HOMEADVISOR HAPPINESS GUARANTEE
a. Definitions
1) “HomeAdvisor Platform” means HomeAdvisor’s website, HomeAdvisor’s mobile app, or over the phone with a HomeAdvisor representative.
2) “Qualifying Service” means a service performed by a Service Professional matched to you by HomeAdvisor and which you fully paid for through the HomeAdvisor Platform.
b. HomeAdvisor Happiness Guarantee
1) The HomeAdvisor Happiness Guarantee provides certain limited protections provided by HomeAdvisor for Qualifying Services. Subject to the below exclusions and the terms and conditions and limitations herein, if you are dissatisfied with the performance of a Qualifying Service, HomeAdvisor will either (a) have the Qualifying Service reperformed by the same or a different Service Professional; or (b) compensate you: (1) the amount you paid though the HomeAdvisor Platform for the Qualifying Service; plus (2) the amount of damage that can be proven by you, in HomeAdvisor’s sole determination, was directly caused by such Qualifying Service. In no event shall HomeAdvisor’s liability under the HomeAdvisor Happiness Guarantee exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) per incident.
2) A note about exclusions: Please note that you may purchase services through HomeAdvisor that have fixed, upfront prices, or you may purchase services through HomeAdvisor that are later negotiated with the Service Professional. The applicable exclusions of the HomeAdvisor Happiness Guarantee are different depending upon whether or not you paid a fixed, upfront price for the Qualifying Service. See Subsections (e) and (f) for details.
c. Eligibility—You are eligible for the HomeAdvisor Service Guarantee provided that you report the issue within ninety (90) days after you made the last payment toward the Qualifying Service by contacting HomeAdvisor by phone at (866) 786-8474, by email at customersolutions@homeadvisor.com, or by online chat and providing all of the requested information about your issue. If you do not report the issue within ninety (90) days after you made the last payment toward the Qualifying Service, your claim is ineligible for the HomeAdvisor Happiness Guarantee. For recurring services, each time the Qualifying Service was performed is treated as a separate incident.
d. Insurance—If you or the Service Professional carry insurance that would cover you in the event of a claim (e.g., when a fire occurs), such as renter's insurance, homeowner's insurance, automobile insurance or an umbrella policy ("Personal Insurance"), you agree that your Personal Insurance is primary and the HomeAdvisor Happiness Guarantee is secondary.

AFFILIATE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL PRE-SCREENING. While we will not match you with a service professional from our affiliates, we may display to you service professionals from our affiliates, including but not limited to Angie's List. These service professionals have NOT been screened by HomeAdvisor using the screening set forth in Section 11. Rather, these service professionals have been screened as follows:

HomeAdvisor will only display Angie's List Service professionals that
Have an Overall "A" or "B: rating from member reviews;
Have passed all background checks established by Angie's List (as described below);
Attest that they possess all applicable state and local licensing, registration, or other trade requirements to provide service for the Project or the project described in the Lead; and
Are in good business standing with Angie's ListAngie's List has criminal background checks performed annually on the principal/owner or relevant manager of all "A"- and "B"-rated companies that are Certified Service Providers, that offer ecommerce offers, that receive leads through the Projects Submissions platform, or that are granted the Super Service Award. The background check currently is performed by American Business Services ("ABS"), a third-party screening company. Upon processing the background check, ABS will provide Angie's List with a simple "pass" or "fail" designation. A failed background check is one that finds one or more of the following: (1) any violent or theft conviction at a felony level in the last 7 years; (2) any sexual felony conviction or on a sexual offender registry at any time (no time limit); or (3) any pending felony charges involving any of types (1) or (2).ABS will provide Angie's List with only a pass or fail designation. Angie's List and its members will never see any content from background check results. Since we can only perform these background checks annually, we ask anyone with knowledge of legal, ethical or financial concerns regarding a company contact us by either logging in and selecting Send A Message using our contact form. Angie's List will investigate any information we receive regarding a company's background.While we always strive to provide the most current information, we also recommend that you perform your own research on the companies you hire.

AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES AND GOVERNING LAW
The exclusive means of resolving any dispute between you and HomeAdvisor or any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to use of this Website and/or HomeAdvisor's services (including any alleged breach of these Terms and Conditions) shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration Association, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE FEDERAL OR STATE LAW. You may not under any circumstances commence, participate in or maintain against HomeAdvisor any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.
*NOTICE OF RIGHTS*
By using the Website and/or HomeAdvisor's services in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and HomeAdvisor. YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.
Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against HomeAdvisor may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Denver County, Colorado. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
These Terms and Conditions, and any dispute between you and HomeAdvisor, shall be governed by the laws of the state of Colorado without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

19. GENERAL PROVISIONS
You acknowledge and agree that the HomeAdvisor Services are provided to you on an "AS IS" basis without any warranty whatsoever, and your sole and exclusive remedy, and HomeAdvisor's sole obligation to you or any third party for any claim arising out of your use of the HomeAdvisor Services or the HomeAdvisor or apps, is that you are free to discontinue your use of the HomeAdvisor Services or the HomeAdvisor or apps at any time. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, HomeAdvisor EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND YOU AGREE THAT HomeAdvisor SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOST PROFIT), EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (EVEN IF HomeAdvisor HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CONSEQUENCES WHICH FLOW FROM IT. SOME STATES AND PROVINCES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON OR EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. IN SUCH STATES AND PROVINCES, THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. The Terms and Conditions will inure to the benefit of HomeAdvisor's successors, assigns and licensees. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, for any reason, by any court of competent jurisdiction that provision shall be modified in order to make it enforceable, while maintaining the spirit of the provision. Alternatively, if modification is not possible, such provision shall be stricken and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms. The failure of HomeAdvisor to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or the Terms and Conditions must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. The section titles in the Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of the State of Colorado as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely in the State of Colorado and between Colorado residents. You agree to submit to jurisdiction in Colorado and that any claim arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions will be brought solely in a court in Denver County, Colorado. These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between you and HomeAdvisor and supersede all oral and written negotiations or representations of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. These Terms and Conditions may not be modified or amended other than by an agreement signed by both parties.
